the Telmac 1800 was a microcomputer from the 70's 
the original kits later came included with an alphanumberic video display and up to 12 kB of memory
4kB Tiny BASIC can be run on it. 
it was one of hte first computers to run a chip8 interpreter

what my system has:
4K memory
64x32 1-bit display
sound = beeps

implemented via a virtual machine
my 16 frame stack:
    16 8-bit registers (V0 - VF)
    12-bit index register (I)
    PC (Program Counter)
    2 8-bit timers
-See below for image interpretation-

0x000 |--------------------|
      | Interpreter memory |
      |                    |
0x050 | Built-in fontset   |
0x200 |--------------------|
      |                    |
      |                    |
      | Program memory     |
      | and dynamic allocs |
      |                    |
      |                    |
0xFFF |--------------------|


we'll encapsulate our image memory and operations in an Image class and the 64x32 frame will 
be represented as a single chunk of data memoryeach pixel will be a single byte

0x000:|--------------------------------------------------------------|
0x040:|                                                              |
0x080:|                                                              |
0x0C0:|                                                              |
      ...
0x7C0:|--------------------------------------------------------------|

This will be our display we need to make sure to keep track of the 
columns and rows and we'll use malloc to keep track of the starting address of the image memory
it should point to the top left corner of the memory 

#drawing to the console
all drawing is done by xor operation 
all sprites are defined as images with a depth of 1-bit a width of 8 and variable height
width limitation is becasue the sprite is only 1 bit
so for example:

0xF0, 0x90, 0x90, 0x90, 0xF0, // 0

0xF0 is 1111 0000 -> XXXX
0x90 is 1001 0000 -> X  X
0x90 is 1001 0000 -> X  X
0x90 is 1001 0000 -> X  X
0xF0 is 1111 0000 -> XXXX

the reason you see flickering in chip8 programs screen is becasue
of the operation used for the sprites
are drawn over oneanother
so that is why we use the xor operation

//Image.cpp NOtes:
//we will use drawto std out for now sp we can draw graphically to the console
// just until we set up the actual output


//see notes at #drawing to the console
//the interpreter also need to recieve back whether ot not  a pixel was turned off
// this i sused for collision detection
//remmeber that we xor to draw over with the sprites

//we have to be precise whether we extract the bits as 1 or 0
// our image class supports 0 - 255 our XOR's could 
//get messy without the restriction
//now we just need to extract the parameters needed to call XORSprite

N = 4-bit constant
X and Y = 4 bit register identifier
PC = program Counter
I = 16 bit register for memory
VN = one of the 16 available variables N may be 0 to F


0NNN	      ||Call	||Calls machine code routine (RCA 1802 for COSMAC VIP) at address NNN. Not necessary for most ROMs.
