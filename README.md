A lot to read but through the previous texts I was able to utilize this in order to understand some concepts

Other's Projects that I dissected in the making of my own project:
- [Lonami Chip 8 Emulator Tutorial Project](https://github.com/Lonami/chip8-asm64-emu)
- [f0lg0's Chip-8 Emulator](https://github.com/f0lg0/CHIP-8) 
by looking at other's comments throughout this process I have gotten a better understanding as to how it works and what alot of the code actually DOES to make the emulator actually work
